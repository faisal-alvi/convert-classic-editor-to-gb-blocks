# Convert Classic Editor to Gutenberg Blocks

> **⚠️ Note:** This is a beta version of a GB Script Plugin. Use it for contributions only. Get stable version [here][#].


Welcome to the GB Script Plugin repository on GitHub. Get a dive into the source, open issues and contribute! This plugin is useful to convert your Classic Editor Post/Page to Gutenberg Blocks automatically!

## Why we Started

We realized that people in our WordPress community are facing issue to migrate to the Gutenberg WordPress Update. They have thousands of posts in the Classic Editor and they cant find any solution to convert all posts into Gutenberg easily.

Even on the official Gutenberg support, a ticket with the same issue has been closed by mentioning Classic to Gutenberg conversion is not possible yet. That was the moment when we thought to help community by developing such script which automatically does this job.
And we are here :)

Let's have a look at how to use this plugin.

## How to Use

### Step 1

Go to the post/page at back end side and click on the "Convert to Gutenberg Blocks", located at the top of the screen.

### Step 2

A new clone of post/page will be created as a draft and converted into the Gutenberg Blocks.

### Step 3

If you like the new draft, just copy and use the title and slug from the Original post to the new Gutenberg post and delete the original post. You can now publish your new Gutenberg post.
